## UNDERSTANDING CHECK
### 1. Where is the RISC-V program located in the vsd-riscv2 repository?
The reference program is located in the 'samples' folder within vsd-riscv2 repository

### 2. How is the program compiled and loaded into memory?
The program is compiled using 'riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc' toolchain and executed using spike simulator.

### 3. How does the RISC-V core access memory and memory-mapped IO?
Risc-v core access memory using standard LOAD/STORE instructions, where the address determines if it's RAM or a peripheral

### 4. Where would a new FPGA IP block logically integrate in this system?
The new FPGA IP block will be integrated to a memory mapped peripheral on system interconnect. The Risc-v processor will be able to communicate with this by access memory in a particular address range. Bus could be AXI which is mapped with memory
